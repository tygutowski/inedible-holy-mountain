I got tired of Worms and Lukki angering Steve, so I made a mod to fix it.

Note that this mod only prevents enemies from destroying the immediate holy temple brickwork.
This means enemies can still break the brickwork above and below the holy temple, the brickwork at the Pyramid, and the brickwork at the Temples of the Arts.
